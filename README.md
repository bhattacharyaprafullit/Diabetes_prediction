## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various medical features. The project explores data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Multiple machine learning models for classification
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhattacharyaprafullit/Diabetes_prediction.git
    cd Diabetes_prediction
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    - It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    - Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    - For Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

3. **(Optional) Using Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t diabetes-prediction .
    docker run -p 8888:8888 diabetes-prediction
    ```

## Usage

- Open the main Jupyter Notebook file (usually named something like `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`) and run the cells to explore the workflow.
- Alternatively, run Python scripts if provided for training and evaluation.
